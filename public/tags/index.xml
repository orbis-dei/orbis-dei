      <description>Blessed Stanley Rother was the church&amp;rsquo;s first American-born martyr. At the risk of his life, Bl. Stanley willingly persisted in his mission to the Tzâ€™utujil people of Guatemala, saying &amp;ldquo;the shepherd does not run at the first sign of danger.&amp;rdquo; On December 1, 2016, Pope Francis confirmed that Rother had died a martyr, murdered for his faith, and Rother was beatified on September 23, 2017, in Oklahoma City.

      <description>Over the years, there have been hundreds of reported apparitions of Our Blessed Mother. Reported apparitions are generally grouped into three categories:
Constat de Supernaturalitate (Approved): Apparitions whose supernatural character is declared worthy of belief and contain nothing contrary to faith and morals. However, belief in these is not necessary for salvation. Non Constat de Supernaturalitate (Nothing Contrary to the Faith): Apparitions which do not enjoy approval of their supernatural character but are determined to contain nothing contrary to faith and morals.</description>
