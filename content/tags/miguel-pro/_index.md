Blessed Miguel Pro was a Jesuit priest and martyr of the Cristero War.  He was executed by firing squad by the anti-Catholic government, his arms outstreched in the form of a cross, shouting "Viva Cristo Rey!" (Long live Christ the King).

A great book on his life is Fr. M.D. Forrest's Life of Father Pro.
