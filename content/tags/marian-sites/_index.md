title: "Marian Sites"

Over the years, there have been hundreds of reported apparitions of Our Blessed Mother.  Reported apparitions are generally grouped into three categories:

1. **Constat de Supernaturalitate** (Approved): Apparitions whose supernatural character is declared worthy of belief and contain nothing contrary to faith and morals.  However, belief in these is not necessary for salvation.
2. **Non Constat de Supernaturalitate** (Nothing Contrary to the Faith): Apparitions which do not enjoy approval of their supernatural character but are determined to contain nothing contrary to faith and morals.
3. **Constat de Non Supernaturalitate** (Not Worthy of Belief): Claims determined to have no characteristics that show them to be from God.

Formal investigative commissions were not begun until the 17th century, so many traditional apparition sites have not been formally classified by the Church.  We have sought to present apparition sites from the first and second categories, without judgment around each claim.

Other additional Marian devotional sites are included as well.
