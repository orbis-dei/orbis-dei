Blessed Stanley Rother was the church's first American-born martyr.  At the risk of his life, Bl. Stanley willingly persisted in his mission to the Tzâ€™utujil people of Guatemala, saying "the shepherd does not run at the first sign of danger."  On December 1, 2016, Pope Francis confirmed that Rother had died a martyr, murdered for his faith, and Rother was beatified on September 23, 2017, in Oklahoma City.
